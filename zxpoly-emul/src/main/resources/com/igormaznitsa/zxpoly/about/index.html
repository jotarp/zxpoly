<h2>ZX-Poly platform emulator</h2>
<b>Version: </b>2.2.3<br>
<b>Author: </b><a href="http://www.igormaznitsa.com">Igor Maznitsa</a><br>
<b>Project page: </b> <a href="https://github.com/raydac/zxpoly">https://github.com/raydac/zxpoly</a><br>
<p>
    ZX-Poly is attempt to jump over ZX-Spectrum limits and get way to have graphics without atribute clash. The
    idea of the platform was developed by Igor Maznitsa in april 1994. The first emulator was developed in 1998 and
    the current emulator was developed in 2014 to prove the idea.
    <br><br>
    By default the emulator works in ZX-Poly mode, you can move it into ZX-128 mode through <b>Options->ZX-Mode</b>
    menu item.
</p>
<h3>License</h3>
The emulator is published under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL3 license</a>
<h3>Supported formats</h3>
<ol>

</ol>
<h3>Emulated components</h3>
<ol>
    <li>ZX-Spectrum keyboard (<b>SHIFT = CAPS SHIFT</b>, <b>ALT = SYMBOL SHIFT</b>)</li>
    <li>Beta-disk interface</li>
    <li>Kempston mouse (one click by mouse on the emulator form - trap mouse, ESC - free mouse)</li>
    <li>Kempston joystick (by default mapped to PAD keys, customizable through <b>File->Preferences</b>)</li>

</ol>
<h3>Game controller support</h3>
<p>
    Since 2.0.5, gamepad and joysticks are supported. Menu <b>Service-&gt;Game controllers</b> opens window where you
    can activate found game controller and assign it to emulate either kempston or interfaceII. Support of game
    controllers provided through JInput library and sometime it work not well in detection of new conected devices, so
    I recommend restart emulator after game controller connect.<br>
    Emulator uses only X and Y as position parameters and all buttons recognized as Fire.
</p>
<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>F1 - this info (not working in full-screen mode)</li>
    <li>F3 - turbo mode (not working in full-screen mode)</li>
    <li>F4 - play/pause TAP file if loaded (not working in full-screen mode)</li>
    <li>F5 - show/hide virtual ZX keyboard (clickable by mouse, look can be changed in <b>File->Preferences</b>)</li>
    <li>F6 - on/off ZX-Keyboard, useful if a Joystick sharing keys with ZX-Keyboard (but it is still possible use
        ZX-Keyboard with pressed CTRL)
    <li>F8 - make screenshot (not working in full-screen mode)</li>
    <li>F12 - reset</li>
    <li><b>CTRL+mouse wheel - screen scale</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Full-screen mode</h3>
<p>
    It supports some kind of full screen mode. To activate it just select <b>View->Full Screen</b> menu item. To stop
    full screen mode you can press either F11 or ESC.
</p>
<h3>Bootstrap ROM</h3>
<p>
    By default the emulator provides only the ZX-Poly test ROM, ZX-128 ROM can be selected and downloaded through <b>Preferences</b>
    (restart required). But also you can form own ROM binary file and place it into the emulator's root folder as
    '<b>bootstrap.rom</b>'. it can contain up to 3 16Kb pages (usually 0 - 128K, 1 - 48K, 2 - TR-DOS). The file will be
    loaded
    automatically on start.
</p>
<h3>System properties</h3>
Emulator supports two system properties:
<ul>
    <li><b>zxpoly.rom.path</b> contains ROM resource path</li>
    <li><b>zxpoly.int.ticks</b> number of INT ticks between screen refresh request</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emulation of Spec256</h3>
Since 2.0.1 version, the emulator provides minimalistic support for <a
        href="http://www.emulatronia.com/emusdaqui/spec256/index-eng.htm">Spec256</a> games. <a
        href="http://www.emulatronia.com/emusdaqui/spec256/index-eng.htm">Spec256</a> games must be zipped and contain
SNA file in its archive. Because emulation based on multiple (9) working in-parallel CPU (instead virtual 64 bit CPU
in the
original emulator), some games can work not well and they need some extra tuning on register synchronization level.
